C++ is a compiled, statically typed general-purpose programming language. Supports programming paradigms such as 
procedural programming, object-oriented programming, and generic programming. The language has a rich standard 
library, which includes common containers and algorithms, input/output, regular expressions, multithreading support 
and other features. C++ combines features of both high-level and low-level languages. Compared to its predecessor, 
the C language, the greatest attention is paid to supporting object-oriented and generic programming.
