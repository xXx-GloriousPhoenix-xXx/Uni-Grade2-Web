Python is a multi-paradigm, high-level, general-purpose programming language with dynamic strong typing and 
automatic memory management, aimed at increasing developer productivity, code readability and quality, and 
ensuring the portability of programs written in it. The language is completely object-oriented in the sense 
that everything is an object. An unusual feature of the language is that blocks of code are indented. The 
syntax of the language core is minimalist, due to which in practice there is rarely a need to refer to documentation. 

Had experience in middle and high school.
Worked with simple algorithms such as binary search and merge sort.
Also made a simple application called "Tag".
