C is a compiled, statically typed, general-purpose programming language developed in 1969-1973 by Bell Labs 
employee Dennis Ritchie as a development language for B. The design was developed to implement an embedded 
UNIX system, but was subsequently ported to many other platforms. By design, the language's constructs closely 
map to typical machine instructions, resulting in its use in projects that were native to assembly language, 
including both operating systems and various application software for a variety of devices, from supercomputers 
to embedded devices systems.
