HTML is a standardized hypertext markup language for viewing web pages in a browser. Web browsers receive an 
HTML document from the server via HTTP/HTTPS protocols or open it from a local disk, then interpret the code 
into an interface that will be displayed on the monitor screen. 

CSS is a formal language for decoding and describing the appearance of a document written using a markup language. 
Can also be applied to any XML documents, such as SVG or XUL. 

Had experience in high school to write simple pages and 2nd grade of university for more professional page coding.
